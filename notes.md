1. Section Elements with Data Attributes:

html: 
<section data-athlete="NM372">
  <!-- ... -->
</section>
<section data-athlete="SV782">
  <!-- ... -->
</section>

* There were already the two <section> elements with data-athlete attributes in the original HTML. These attributes are used to identify which athlete's data should be displayed in each section.

2. Empty <h2> and <dl> Elements:
<section data-athlete="NM372">
  <h2></h2>
  <dl></dl>
</section>
<section data-athlete="SV782">
  <h2></h2>
  <dl></dl>
</section>

*Within each <section> element, we've added empty <h2> and <dl> elements.

*The <h2> element will be used to display the athlete's ID (e.g., "Athlete: NM372") as specified in the requirements.

*The <dl> element will be used to display the athlete's detailed information in a definition list (key-value pairs).

3. JavaScript Code Populates HTML:

In the JavaScript code (scripts.js), there is a function called createHtml that dynamically generates HTML content for each athlete and appends it to the respective sections. Here's how it works:

*In the createHtml function, an <h2> element was created and its text content was set to the athlete's ID.

* a <dl> element was also created where it will dynamically populate the athlete's details (Full Name, Total Races, Event Date, Total Time) using the template literals (${...}) and inserts them into the HTML.

In summary, changes were made to the HTML by adding empty <h2> and <dl> elements within each athlete's <section> to prepare them for dynamically generated athlete information. The JavaScript code provided will populate these elements with the correct data according to the requirements.
